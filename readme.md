# 📖 Understanding MVC, MVP, MVVM, and MVI: A 🔍 Comparative Guide

## 📌 Introduction

Software architecture plays a crucial role in building scalable and maintainable applications. This guide explores four popular architectural patterns—**MVC (Model-View-Controller), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), and MVI (Model-View-Intent)**—detailing their history, purpose, advantages, and drawbacks.

## 📌 Model-View-Controller (MVC)

### 🔹 When & Who Introduced It?

- Introduced in **the late 1970s** by **Trygve Reenskaug** at **Xerox PARC** while working on Smalltalk-76.

### 🔹 Why Was It Introduced?

- **Problem with previous approaches**: UI logic and business logic were tightly coupled.
- **Solution**: MVC separates concerns, making applications more maintainable and scalable.

### 🔹 Components

1. **Model** – Handles data and business logic.
2. **View** – Displays UI and interacts with the user.
3. **Controller** – Manages input and updates the Model.

### ✅ Merits

✔️ Clear separation of concerns.  
✔️ Promotes parallel development.  
✔️ Enhances code reusability.

### ❌ Demerits

❌ Tight coupling between View and Controller.  
❌ Controllers can become complex in large applications.

## 📌 Model-View-Presenter (MVP)

### 🔹 When & Who Introduced It?

- Evolved from MVC in the **1990s** to improve testability and separation of concerns.

### 🔹 Why Was It Introduced?

- **Problem with MVC**: Controllers became too complex.
- **Solution**: MVP offloads logic to Presenters, making Views passive.

### 🔹 Components

1. **Model** – Handles data and business logic.
2. **View** – Displays UI and forwards events to the Presenter.
3. **Presenter** – Acts as a middleman, updating the View and Model.

### ✅ Merits

✔️ Better separation of concerns than MVC.  
✔️ Improved unit testability.  
✔️ Views remain lightweight.

### ❌ Demerits

❌ Presenters can become bloated.  
❌ Requires more boilerplate code.

## 📌 Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

### 🔹 When & Who Introduced It?

- Introduced by **Microsoft in 2005** for **WPF applications**.

### 🔹 Why Was It Introduced?

- **Problem with MVP**: Presenters often contained too much logic.
- **Solution**: MVVM introduced ViewModel, enabling data binding and reducing direct UI manipulation.

### 🔹 Components

1. **Model** – Business logic and data handling.
2. **View** – Displays UI and binds data from ViewModel.
3. **ViewModel** – Manages UI-related data and communicates with the Model.

### ✅ Merits

✔️ Cleaner separation of concerns than MVP.  
✔️ Easy to test as ViewModel has no UI reference.  
✔️ Works well with data-binding frameworks.

### ❌ Demerits

❌ Can introduce complexity with data binding.  
❌ Memory leaks if ViewModel is not managed properly.

## 📌 Model-View-Intent (MVI)

### 🔹 When & Who Introduced It?

- Gained popularity with **reactive programming** and **unidirectional data flow** concepts.

### 🔹 Why Was It Introduced?

- **Problem with MVVM**: Complex state management and potential data inconsistency.
- **Solution**: MVI enforces **predictable state changes** using a **single source of truth**.

### 🔹 Components

1. **Model** – Represents state and handles business logic.
2. **View** – Displays the UI and listens for state changes.
3. **Intent** – Captures user actions and updates Model accordingly.

### ✅ Merits

✔️ Ensures predictable state changes.  
✔️ Aligns well with reactive programming.  
✔️ Makes debugging easier with unidirectional data flow.

### ❌ Demerits

❌ Higher learning curve.  
❌ More boilerplate code than MVVM.

| 📅 **Introduced**       | 1996                              | 2005                                           |
| 🏗 **Structure**         | View → Presenter → Model          | View → ViewModel → Model                       |
| 🔄 **Data Flow**        | Presenter handles UI updates      | ViewModel automatically updates View           |
| 🔄 **Data Binding**     | Manual updates required           | Supports **LiveData** & **Data Binding**       |

| 📉 **Boilerplate Code** | More due to manual updates        | Less due to LiveData & Data Binding            |
| 🛠 **Use Case**          | Medium-sized apps                 | Apps using **LiveData, Coroutines, or RxJava** |
| ❌ **Demerits**         | Presenter becomes bloated         | Can lead to complex state management           |

### ✅ When to Use What?

- **Use MVP** for **apps that require testable UI logic** but don’t need LiveData.
- **Use MVVM** for **apps that rely on LiveData, Coroutines, and require less boilerplate**.

## 🆚 MVVM vs MVI

| Feature                 | **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**          | **MVI (Model-View-Intent)**                   |

| 📉 **Boilerplate Code** | Less due to Data Binding                 | Requires **more boilerplate**                 |
| 🏷 **Role of View**      | Observes ViewModel & updates UI          | Renders UI based on state updates             |
| 🧠 **Logic Handling**   | ViewModel holds logic                    | State is **immutable**, reducing side effects |
| 🧪 **Testability**      | High                                     | **Highest** (State-based, easier to debug)    |
| 🚀 **Performance**      | Fast, but can have state inconsistencies | Predictable, but more resource-heavy          |
| 🛠 **Use Case**          | Apps with **LiveData & Coroutines**      | Apps needing **predictable state management** |
| ❌ **Demerits**         | State inconsistencies, complex debugging | More **boilerplate**, not beginner-friendly   |

### ✅ When to Use What?

- **Use MVVM** if you need **LiveData, two-way data binding, or Coroutines**.
- **Use MVI** if you want **fully predictable state management** and are comfortable with **RxJava or Kotlin Flow**.
